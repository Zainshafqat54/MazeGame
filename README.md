# Maze_Game
A C++ implementation of a command line maze game where the player navigates through a maze, avoiding walls and obstacles to reach the exit. Input includes maze size and layout, and output shows the maze and player's position after each move. ASCII characters represent the maze and player.

## Running the program
To run the program, navigate to the project directory in a terminal and run:
- g++ MazeGame.cpp -o MazeGame
- ./MazeGame
 
 
## Gameplay
- The player starts at the entrance of the maze and has to reach the exit.
- The player can move up, down, left, or right using the arrow keys.
- The player has to avoid walls and obstacles in the maze.
- The game ends when the player reaches the exit or gets stuck.

## Input
- The program takes the size of the maze and the layout of the walls and obstacles as input.

## Output
- The program outputs the maze and the player's position after each move.

## Note
- The program uses ASCII characters to represent the maze and the player's position.
- The program does not save the player's progress, so it has to be restarted from the beginning each time it is played.
